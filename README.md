## Project Abstract
Currently, Boise State Universityâ€™s Computational Biosciences Lab (CBL) simulates and models knee joint movement and stresses by producing numeric datasets and results for osteoarthritis patients based on various parameters such as loading conditions, anatomy, and movement. To make medical data more easily understandable for clinicians, we built this easy-to-use web application where an user can upload data files, see a visual heat map of output, and observe live updates to the visualization as parameters are changed.  

## Project Description
The web application we've built primarily performs four key functionalities as follows:</br>
- File Uploading: Users upload geometry and results data files in .csv format.
- Data Parsing: The website parses these correctly and handles the data in a way that the website can use to
create an image.
- Image Generating: The website uses the parsed data to modify the image of the knee.
- Image Changing when Parameters Updated: When parameters are input, the map accurately changes to reflect the changed parameter(s).

To use this web application, users click on the "Choose File" button on the upper left of the web page following the title "Geometry File" and select a Geometry data file in .csv format from their local drive or the users could click on the "Choose File" button on the upper left of the web page following the title "Results File" and select a Results data file in .csv format from their local drive. Once file is chosen, click on the button "Draw", the users will see an image on the right side of the web page showing the distribution of the data. __Figure1__ is the snapshot of the visualized Geometry data and __Figure2__ is the snapshot of the visualized Results data. Users could also update the data parameters by
